Predicting how snow will behave is a pretty difficult mathematical problem to solve. Does certain snow roll, slide, or clump? How does snow with a density of 25 behave differently than snow with a density of 300 (kg/m^3)? What about packed snow with fluffy snow on top, how does that change the movement of snow?  Is snow even a solid or a liquid?

To understand how snow falls, tons of research is needed, including simulations of real-world physics with different kinds of snow examples. Creating simulations with real-world physics is HARD. It requires creating accurate mathematical models of the real-life laws of physics, that's a lot of math.... which it takes a lot of computing power... and there has never been a really big need to understand snow better. All you really need to know is that if it's cold, it might snow, and if it gets colder, that snow might turn to ice so drive slower.... right?

Disney decided that wasn't the case! When the movie Frozen was being made, Disney wanted the snow to look as real as possible (even though the movie is an animation, and by default isn't realistic looking... I mean just look at how big Elsa's eyes are!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), so they reached out to computer graphics researcher, Chenfanfu Jiang, who advanced a technique known as- "**Material Point Method**" to create simulations of realistic snow for the movie Frozen.

Material Point Method is a system of numerical calculations that are used to simulate the behavior of any material - solids, liquids, or gases (or a mix, like snow!). 

The advancement in MPM led by the use in the movie Frozen is now being used to study safer avalanche mitigation techniques AND solving 67-year old avalanche mysteries

TW: death & trauma

67 years ago, nine Russian cross-country skiers went out on an overnight 200 KM trek. When the skiers never returned from their journey, a search party was sent out to look for them. A month later their bodies, tent, and camp were found, surprisingly, not covered by snow. The skiers were found over a mile away from the campsite with their eyes gouged out, shattered ribs, and broken skulls‚Äî injuries that aren't typically caused by an avalanche. 

Since the tent wasn't covered in snow, the tent was created on a 20-degree sloped hill, (avalanches occur on a slopped hill of 30 degrees or more), which could have caused the skier's injuries and death? People had theories from a Yeti to aliens causing their deaths.

When Swiss researchers saw the movie Frozen, they wondered if they could use the snow simulation from Frozen to try and simulate an avalanche in the conditions that the Russians cross country skiers were in.

The computer scientists and animaters from Frozen were asked to adjust the parameters to match the conditions of the 67-year-old mystery and were able to simulate the outcome of injuries. And they were able to show how an avalanche could occur, and cause the injuries the Russian skiers received. Mystery solved, I guess it wasn't the Yeti after all.
