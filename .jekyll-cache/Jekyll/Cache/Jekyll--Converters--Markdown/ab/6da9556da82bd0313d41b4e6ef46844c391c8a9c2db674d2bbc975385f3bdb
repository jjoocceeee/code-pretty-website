I"c<p>Predicting how snow will behave is a pretty difficult mathematical problem to solve. Does certain snow roll, slide, or clump? How does snow with a density of 25 behave differently than snow with a density of 300 (kg/m^3)? What about packed snow with fluffy snow on top, how does that change the movement of snow?  Is snow even a solid or a liquid?</p>
